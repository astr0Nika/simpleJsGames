## Catch Numbers

The game takes place on a grid filled with numbers. The player starts at a random position and can move in four directions (left, right, up, down). However, instead of moving just one step at a time, the player moves a number of spaces equal to the value of the neighboring tile in the chosen direction. When a tile is crossed, its number is added to the player's score and the tile becomes inactive â€” its number disappears and it can no longer be stepped on or crossed again. The player cannot move if the move would take them outside the grid or onto an inactive tile. The game ends when no valid moves remain.
